# Emotes

Currently a work in progress. Soon to allow users to perform a variety of operations on emotes and operate on data from a data science perspective.

# Commands

`..add`
 - Aliases: `addemote`
 - Description: Adds an emote to the guild/server the command is invoked in.
 - Usage: `<id from bot database>`, `<name> <id from bot database>`, `<name> <image-url>`, `<name> <emote>`, `<emote> | <multiple emotes>`

`..random`
- Aliases: `randomemote`
- Description: Sends a random emote from the database.

`..ping`
- Description: Pings the bot.
